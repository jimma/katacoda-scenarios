Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) is a Java programming language API spec that provides support in creating web services according to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern. Resteasy is a portable implementation of JAX-RS. In this tutorial, we'll use Resteasy to create a simple RESTful Web application and a client to invoke it.

##Â Prepare the environment

What we need includes: 
* java 
* Maven
* Web Container
* Resteasy
WildFLy is the best choice for web container, in which Resteasy API is pre-installed. In this case, we'll use java 8, Maven 3.5.0 and WildFly 11.0.0 Final as our environment.
